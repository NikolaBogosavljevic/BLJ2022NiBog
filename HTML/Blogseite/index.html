                Ali ovaj put zaboravi na mene
                Kažu ti da si isteko pre roka
                U mojoj knjizi utisaka ti si slaba trojka
                Hajde, zaboravi na to
                Ne treba mi ljubav, meni treba lom
                Praštaj, lutko, sad sve
                Ja reći ću ti ne
                Koliko pijem, nije humano
                Subota je dan za alkohol
                Uno momento, uspori tempo
                Možda sutra se vidimo
                Tika-taka, tika-tak
                Isteklo ti vrijeme, pao si kod mene
                Baš si sladak kad si ljut
                Više sreće drugi put
                Nisi moj tip, neću da te lažem
                Tražiš moj broj, zini da ti kažem
                Želeo bi da idemo kod tebe
                Ali tamo noćas vodiš samo sebe
                Hajde, zaboravi na to
                Ne treba mi ljubav, meni treba lom
                Praštaj, lutko, sada sve

            <div class="col-md-3"><h1>One Piece</h1>""Straw Hat"" Luffy, this book's boy hero, really wants to be a pirate. His fellow villagers jeer at his goal, since he can't swim, due to having eaten a magic fruit that gives him the ability to stretch his body like rubber. However, Luffy isn't going to let a little problem like this stop him. He's further motivated when pirate captain ""Red-Haired"" Shanks (an eccentric seadog who might give Johnny Depp a run for his money) sacrifices his arm to a sea-monster to save Luffy's life. Ten years later, Luffy is still determined to make his dream come true, and he sets out to assemble to a crew and find a fabled treasure (the ""One Piece"" of the title). Luffy meets Koby, a cabin boy his age, who has been shanghaied by a lady pirate, and together they attempt to rescue Roronoa Zoro, a feared bounty hunter who is being held captive by the dread Captain Morgan. Everyone in this title has a seemingly impossible goal driving them on, whether it's Luffy's dream of being a pirate, Koby's of joining the navy, or Zoro's of become the world's greatest swordsman. It's this strong-and sometimes touching--motivation which carries the story along through episodes that mix comedy and violence in an inventive, energetic brew. Luffy uses his gum gum power at climactic moments, such as taking out Iron Mace Alvida, a lady pirate whose claim to be the fairest on all the seas is anything but accurate. One Piece is one of the world's most popular manga, having been spun off into a TV show, a video game and merchandising. With Pirates of the Caribbean spearheading a full-on pirate revival, One Piece should have no trouble finding an audience in America.</div>
            <div class="col-md-3"><h1>Tate</h1>Tate starts the video by discussing his childhood, which he describes as difficult, both in his native Chicago and after his move to Luton following his parents’ divorce. “I’m very, very happy that my life has been difficult because it is difficult to become a man of my capabilities without the struggles, without facing adversities and without overcoming often insurmountable odds,” he says. “Even from a very, very young age, I was taught that going to the authorities and crying and hoping someone else is going to fix your problems is not the way a man conducts himself.”Tate said that as a child his father encouraged him to deal with his own problems and not go to authorities, encouraging him to fightback against bullies including hitting one around the face with a lunch box on the school bus. In high school, Andrew says he had the reputation of being the guy no one really messes with but he wasn’t a bully. He says: “I actually had a friend in school who was gay, I have five main friends  and I was also friends with a gay guy. And he would make fun of me for being American and I would make fun of him for being gay back then but the world was a very different place.”</div>
